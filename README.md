# Food Ratings GraphQL API

A public GraphQL API for getting information about food hygiene ratings of restaurants in UK. 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/jTT2I0ZHuzGlK495pI/source.gif)

The data provide the food hygiene rating or inspection result given to a business and reflect the standards of food hygiene found on the date of inspection or visit by the local authority. Businesses include restaurants, pubs, caf√©s, takeaways, hotels and other places consumers eat, as well as supermarkets and other food shops.

This project uses [Food Hygiene Rating Scheme API (Version 2)](http://api.ratings.food.gov.uk/help) as a data source, so the schema follows the shape of that data.

## Writing queries

```graphql
query Establishment {
  establishments(localAuthorityId: 195, ratingName: "5", name: "Indian" address: "Darwen") {
    BusinessName
    BusinessType {
      BusinessTypeName
    }
    Rating {
      ratingName,
      
    }
    AddressLine2
    AddressLine4
  }
}
```

The above GraphQL query will produce the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "establishments": [
      {
        "BusinessName": "Akash Indian Takeaway",
        "BusinessType": {
          "BusinessTypeName": "Takeaway/sandwich shop"
        },
        "Rating": {
          "ratingName": "5"
        },
        "AddressLine2": "194 Duckworth Street",
        "AddressLine4": "Darwen"
      },
      {
        "BusinessName": "India 2 U",
        "BusinessType": {
          "BusinessTypeName": "Takeaway/sandwich shop"
        },
        "Rating": {
          "ratingName": "3"
        },
        "AddressLine2": "6 Fore Street",
        "AddressLine4": "Lower Darwen"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
